PRICE JUSTIFICATION — WHY £4.49?
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. COST-PLUS FOUNDATION
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Ingredient Complexity:
   • Premium oat milk base (20-30% higher cost than dairy)
   • Pistachio extract and white chocolate flavoring (specialty ingredients)
   • Tapioca pearls requiring specialized preservation technology
   • Quality coffee concentrate for functionality

   Production Challenges:
   • Cold chain logistics throughout distribution
   • Shelf-stable tapioca pearls (technical innovation required)
   • Multi-component product requiring careful formulation
   • Premium packaging to protect product integrity

   Estimated COGS: £1.80-2.10 per unit (40-47% of retail)
   Target Margin: 50-60% to support marketing and distribution

2. COMPETITIVE ANCHORING
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   "We're not the cheapest, but we're the most innovative"
   — Price signals quality while remaining accessible

3. PSYCHOLOGICAL PRICING
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
